# Feature Finder

## WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a rust command line application to parse gff files according to specific
criteria. I am using this to learn how to create rust command line tools. Some
of this project will probably end up being over engineered for the sake of
learning.

Description:
This is a tool to parse gff files according to criteria.

General Usage:
featureFinder -i file.gff -o output.txt -c chromosome -t type -s startindex -e
endindex
